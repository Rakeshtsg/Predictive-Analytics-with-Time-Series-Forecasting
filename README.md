#Predictive Analytics with Time Series Forecasting for Learn Flow Internship

Introduction

Predictive analytics with time series forecasting offers a powerful technique for predicting future values based on historical data. It plays a vital role in diverse fields, including finance, economics, and science. By employing various statistical and machine learning algorithms, time series forecasting models can effectively predict a wide range of phenomena, such as stock prices, sales figures, and weather patterns.

Problem Statement

The overarching objective of this Learn Flow Internship project is to develop a time series forecasting model for predicting future temperature values based on historical data. The Daily Climate Time Series Data dataset will be utilized to forecast future temperature values.

Objectives

Conceptual Understanding: Grasp the fundamental concepts of time series forecasting
Model Building: Learn how to construct time series forecasting models using statistical and machine learning algorithms
Practical Application: Apply time series forecasting to predict future temperature values
Prerequisites

Basic Python Programming: Familiarity with Python programming fundamentals
Statistical Concepts: Understanding of statistical concepts such as time series analysis and stationarity
Dataset

The Daily Climate Time Series Data dataset will be employed for this project. This dataset comprises daily temperature data for various locations worldwide.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

a. Data Loading and Missing Value Check: Load the data and identify any missing values.

b. Date Format Conversion: Convert the date column to a suitable datetime format.

c. Date Index: Set the date column as the index of the DataFrame.

d. Stationarity Analysis: Assess stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.

Model Selection:

a. Stationarity-Based Model Choice: Select an appropriate time series forecasting model based on data stationarity.

i. **Stationary Data:** If the data is stationary, employ an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

ii. **Non-Stationary Data:** If the data is non-stationary, utilize a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMAX) model.
Model Training:

a. Historical Data Training: Train the chosen time series forecasting model on the historical data.

Evaluation:

a. Performance Assessment: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).

Forecasting:

a. Future Prediction: Employ the trained model to predict future temperature values.

Visualization:

a. Data Visualization: Visualize the historical data, forecast values, and model performance.
